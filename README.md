# Recess-project
[Salient object](https://paperswithcode.com/task/salient-object-detection) detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. We propose 
a multi salient object subitization model for classifying and categorizing images based on the number of salient objects they contain.

# The objectives of the project are:
To develop a model that enhance salient objects detection uniformly meanwhile suppress irrelevant background.

To train the model to recognize image inputs

To train the model to differentiate between salient parts and irrelevant background parts of the image.

# Product Scope.
The Multi Salient Object detection system, is unified for all types of images including PNG, JPG and TIFF. 
The system will allow the user to input an image through a graphical user interface, the image them will be displayed in a browser window. The number of salient objects in the image/scene are then displayed to the user. The system in addition will allow the user to apply changes to the images e.g. cropping, rotating, flipping among other. These will not affect the original image.
